# Flexbox Layout in CuteStrap
Flexbox layout implementation in CuteStrap is based on the Flexbox CSS Feature. Its very close replica of  the Flexbox implemented in AngularJS Material Flexbox Layout.

## Layout Containers
Two type of layout containers are: ```.cs-layout-row``` and ```.cs-layout-column``` for row-wise and column-wise layout.
Row-wise layout places children in horizontal order, and column-wise layout places children in vertical order.

### Use of Row layout
To use row layout, you need to include ```.cs-layout-row``` in css classes of the parent element.

```html
    <element class="... cs-layout-row ...">
        ...
        ...
        children elements here...
        ...
        ...
    </element>
```
### Use of Column layout
To use row layout, you need to include ```.cs-layout-column``` in css classes of the parent element.

```html
    <element class="... cs-layout-column ...">
        ...
        ...
        children elements here...
        ...
        ...
    </element>
```
