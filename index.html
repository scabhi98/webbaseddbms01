                        The letter A is awesome! <br>
                        It simply is the best. <br>
                        Without an A, you could not get <br>
                        an A+ on a test. <br>
                        You’d never see an acrobat <br>
                        or eat an apple pie. <br>
                        You couldn’t be an astronaut <br>
                        or kiss your aunt goodbye. <br>
                        An antelope would not exist. <br>
                        An ape would be unknown. <br>
                        You’d never hear a person <br>
                        say “Afraid” or “All Alone”. <br>
                        The A’s in avocado <br>
                        would completely disappear <br>
                        and certain words would be forgot <br>
                        like “ankle”, “arm”, and “ear”. <br>

                    <p>
                        You watch your boy struggle with giving <br>
                        up the turtle, returning it to the pond <br>
                        where he’d found it on a walk— <br>
                        first time you’d all been out in days. <br>

                        How thoughtful he thought he’d been, <br>
                        making it a home in the home <br>
                        where the family sheltered in place. <br>
                        How he cared for his armored friend. <br>

                        Having picked flowers, knowing they’d die, <br>
                        you understand the urge to pluck <br>
                        the exotic, the beautiful—any diversion <br>
                        from fear, which is in itself a disease. <br>

                        That morning, you helped your boy <br>
                        give up the idea of living forever. <br>
