                        where he’d found it on a walk— <br>
                        first time you’d all been out in days. <br>

                    <p>
                        You watch your boy struggle with giving <br>
                        up the turtle, returning it to the pond <br>
                        where he’d found it on a walk— <br>
                        first time you’d all been out in days. <br>

                        How thoughtful he thought he’d been, <br>
                        making it a home in the home <br>
                        where the family sheltered in place. <br>
                        How he cared for his armored friend. <br>

                        Having picked flowers, knowing they’d die, <br>
                        you understand the urge to pluck <br>
                        the exotic, the beautiful—any diversion <br>
                        from fear, which is in itself a disease. <br>

                        That morning, you helped your boy <br>
                        give up the idea of living forever. <br>
                    </p>
